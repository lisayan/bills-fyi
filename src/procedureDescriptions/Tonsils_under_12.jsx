                'Tonsillectomy (ton-sih-LEK-tuh-me) is the surgical removal of the tonsils, two oval-shaped pads of tissue at the back of the throat â€” one tonsil on each side.',
                "A tonsillectomy was once a common procedure to treat infection and inflammation of the tonsils (tonsillitis).

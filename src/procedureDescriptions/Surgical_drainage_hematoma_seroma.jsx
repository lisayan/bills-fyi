                'Surgical drainage of hematoma is a medical procedure that involves the removal of blood that has accumulated in a localized area due to an injury or surgery. The procedure is performed under local or general anesthesia, depending on the severity of the hematoma.Sutures, or stitches, hold your tissue together using surgical thread. A surgeon will use a surgical needle to sew your skin back together in the same way that youâ€™d sew two pieces of fabric together.',
                'The surgeon makes an incision in the affected area to access the hematoma. They then use a suction device or a syringe to remove the blood. After the hematoma has been drained, the surgeon may pack the area with gauze to help prevent further bleeding and promote healing.'

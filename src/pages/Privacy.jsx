                    <p>Welcome to Turnip Health, a website available at turnip.health (the “Site”). The Site and related services (collectively, the “Services”) are owned and operated by Turnip Health Inc ("Turnip Health", “we”, “us,” or “our”). We have developed this Privacy Policy to inform our users (“user(s),” “you,” or “your”) about how we collect data through our Services, how we use the collected data, and a user’s rights with respect to the collected data.

Turnip Health is hosted and operated in the United States. If you use the Services from outside the United States, please be aware that the information you provide to us is transmitted to, processed, and stored in the United States. Data will be collected, processed, maintained, and used subject to this Privacy Policy and applicable privacy laws in the United States and in the European Economic Area (the “EEA” and citizens thereof referred to herein as “Data Subjects”). These laws may be different from the privacy laws in your country. However, this does not change our commitments to safeguard your privacy, and we will comply with all applicable laws relating to the cross-border transfer of your Personal Data (as that term is described below).

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy, then do not access or use the Services. By accessing and/or using the Services, you accept and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, which are hereby incorporated by reference.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at support@turnip.health.

1. Data We Collect
When you use the Site, we collect and process the following types of information:

Information We Collect about You
We collect information about your use of our Services, including but not limited to your Internet connections, computer equipment, web browsers, sites visited before using or accessing our Site, sites visited after leaving our Site, and other similar information about traffic and usage, as you navigate to, through, and away from our Site(s)). This is called “Non-Personal Data” because it does not identify you, but provides insights to us regarding your use of the Services. Non-Personal Data may become linked to you and/or your account only after you submit certain types of Personal Data to us, e.g. logging into your Site account. This does not apply, however, after you have left our Site.

We also use automated data collection tools, such as Cookies and Web Beacons, to collect certain types of Non-Personal Data. By using our Services, you acknowledge that we use these data collection tools and accept the terms of our Cookie Notification. You can set your browser to reject Cookies, but that may limit your use of some convenience features on the Services. For more information on Cookies and how to control Cookies on your web browser, please search the web.

Web Beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, and to monitor how many visitors view our Services. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the device, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages or in an e-mail.

Log Data refers to certain information about how a user (including both account holders and non-Account holders) uses our Services. Log Data may include information such as a user’s Internet Protocol address, browser type, operating system, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a user clicked on, and other statistics.

You may be given the option to receive push notifications while using our Services. In order to serve push notifications, we may need to collect your IP address and a persistent identifier from your device. You can turn off push notifications in your device settings.

Information You Provide
When you register to use our Services, place an order, set up an account, respond to communications (e.g., surveys, requests for feedback), contact us via phone, e-mail, or postal mail, and so on, we will collect certain types of the information you provide to us. This may include, but is not limited to your first and last name(s), mailing address, e-mail address, phone number, organization, payment information, geolocation information, and/or your IP address. By using the Services, you may also choose to disclose or provide your communication preferences, your physical location, and your demographic information. This type of data is called “Personal Data” because it can be used to identify you.When you wish to make a payment to Turnip Health for our Services, you may choose how you would like to do so.

You may provide your payment information (i.e. credit card number, cvc number, and billing zip code) through our Site, in which case our payment processing service provider, Stripe, will then process the payment for us. The only payment information that we retain from you is the billing zip code, last four (4) digits of the payment card, and the card’s expiration date. We then save an identifier token from Stripe that we can use to bill the same card on subsequent purchases without requiring you to re-enter your information.

Collectively in this Privacy Policy, Personal Data and Non-Personal Data is referenced as “Data.”

Geolocation Data
When you connect to the Services, we are able to recognize the internet (IP) address of the computer providing you with internet access. Our use of this IP address may be to help diagnose problems with our server or otherwise administer our Services. This IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic information. Your IP address is never associated with you as an individual (unless you have first logged into your account with your personal log-in information) and is never provided to another company or organization besides web services such as Amazon Web Services, Datadog, Sentry, etc that are needed to maintain website operations.

Third-Party Social Networking Service(s)
Additionally, if you choose to access, visit, and/or use any third-party social networking service(s) that may be integrated with our Service, we may receive your Personal Data and other information about you and your computer, mobile, or other device that you have made available to those social networking services, including information about your contacts on those services. For example, some social networking services allow you to push content from our Service to your contacts or to pull information about your contacts so you can connect with them on or through our Service. Some social networking services also will facilitate your registration for our Service or enhance or personalize your experience on our Service. Your decision to use a social networking service in connection with our Service is voluntary. However, you should make sure you are comfortable with the information your third-party social networking services may make available to our Service by visiting those services’ privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy settings directly with those services.
